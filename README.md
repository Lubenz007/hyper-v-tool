My tool to create vm's in my lab

Utilizing a standalone Hyper-V server and generating VMs from a golden image might be considered an older approach, but it's one I personally prefer. Over the years, I've diligently maintained a tool for crafting VMs on my Hyper-V host within the lab environment. I employ SSH to connect to the Hyper-V host and initiate the VM creation process. This tool provides a streamlined menu system that automatically configures the VM, allowing me to promptly begin using it.
