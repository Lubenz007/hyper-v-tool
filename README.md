My tool to create vm's in my lab

Utilizing a standalone Hyper-V server and generating VMs from a golden image might be considered an older approach, but it's one I personally prefer. Over the years, I've diligently maintained a tool for crafting VMs on my Hyper-V host within the lab environment. I employ SSH to connect to the Hyper-V host and initiate the VM creation process. This tool provides a streamlined menu system that automatically configures the VM, allowing me to promptly begin using it.
It needs Oscdimg
* You can find the oscdimg.exe in the Windows 11 22h2 ADK: 
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install 
* Kit "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Deployment Tools\arm64\Oscdimg"
